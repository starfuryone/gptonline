**Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive technical architecture for a SaaS product that integrates AI-powered functions directly into Google Sheets. The product provides three core functionalities through custom formulas: data cleaning, SEO utilities, and text summarization. The system operates on a credit-based usage model with real-time balance tracking, Stripe payment integration, and a live sidebar interface within Google Sheets.

The architecture leverages Google Apps Script for frontend integration, a scalable Node.js backend for AI processing and credit management, and Stripe for payment processing. The system supports tiered credit packs, free trial balances, and team usage scenarios while maintaining real-time synchronization between the Google Sheets interface and the backend credit system.




## System Overview

The SaaS Google Sheets AI Functions platform consists of five primary components that work together to deliver AI-powered functionality directly within the Google Sheets environment. The system architecture follows a client-server model where Google Sheets serves as the primary user interface, while a dedicated backend handles AI processing, credit management, and payment processing.

### Core Components

**Google Apps Script Layer**: This component runs within the Google Sheets environment and provides the custom functions (`=GPT_CLEAN()`, `=GPT_SEO()`, `=GPT_SUMMARIZE()`) and the sidebar user interface. It handles user authentication, function execution, and real-time communication with the backend API.

**Backend API Server**: A Node.js-based RESTful API that processes AI requests, manages user credits, handles authentication, and coordinates with external services. This server maintains the business logic for credit deduction, usage tracking, and AI model integration.

**Database Layer**: A PostgreSQL database that stores user accounts, credit balances, usage history, subscription information, and team management data. The database ensures data consistency and supports complex queries for analytics and reporting.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration handles credit pack purchases, subscription management, and webhook processing for real-time payment updates. This component manages the entire payment lifecycle from purchase to credit allocation.

**AI Processing Engine**: Integration with OpenAI's GPT models for executing the three core functions. This component handles prompt engineering, response processing, and error handling for AI operations.

### Data Flow Architecture

The system operates through a series of coordinated interactions between components. When a user invokes a custom function in Google Sheets, the Apps Script layer authenticates the request and forwards it to the backend API. The backend validates the user's credit balance, processes the AI request, deducts the appropriate credits, and returns the result to the Google Sheets interface.

The sidebar UI maintains a persistent connection to the backend through periodic polling, ensuring that credit balances and usage statistics remain current. Payment processing occurs asynchronously through Stripe webhooks, which update user credit balances in real-time without requiring user interaction.

Team usage scenarios involve additional complexity, where team administrators can allocate credits to team members, and usage is tracked both individually and collectively. The system supports role-based access control and usage limits to prevent abuse while maintaining flexibility for different team structures.
