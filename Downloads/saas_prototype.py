"""
Prototype of a SaaS backend for automating product imports from external
websites into a WordPress store.

This module defines a small FastAPI application that exposes a single
endpoint for importing products. It demonstrates how you might structure
your business logic to map a source site for product URLs, scrape the
individual product pages, classify the products, perform a simple
currency conversion, process product images and publish each item to a
WordPress site. The external API calls are simulated using stub
functions because this environment does not provide network access.

Before using this in production you would replace the stubbed
implementations with real API calls and add proper error handling,
authentication and persistence. For example, you could integrate
Firecrawl's API for the mapping and scraping steps, OpenAI's API for
the extraction and classification steps, and a currency conversion
service for currency conversions. Likewise the `upload_to_wordpress`
function would use the WordPress REST API with appropriate credentials.

Usage:
    uvicorn saas_prototype:app --reload

Once the server is running you can POST to `/import` with a JSON body
containing the required fields defined by the `ImportRequest` model.
